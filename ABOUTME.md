Hi!

My name is John Fiore, otherwise known as EpicJohn, and I am a VR YouTuber, and Game Developer. With YT, I primairly focus on a game called "Gorilla Tag" created by a guy named Kerestell Smith (LemmingVR) and his team, AnotherAxiom. And as of November 16, 2022, I have 9,400 subscribers. My games are made using the Unity Game Engine, which utilizes the C# programming language.

My current goals are:
- Reach 10,000 Subscribers
- Reach 100,000 Subscribers
- Release a Full Game with a Full Storyline
- Learn C++ and overall how to use Unreal Engine (4 or 5)
