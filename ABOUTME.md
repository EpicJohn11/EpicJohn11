Hello!

My name is John Fiore, and I am a 14 year old YouTuber and Game Developer.

I make YouTube videos where I play Gorilla Tag, a VR game developed by Another Axiom, which is free on Meta Quest's App Lab and Steam. I also play other games such as Rec Room, VRChat, and others. As of December 5, 2022, I have over 10,000 subscribers.

My games are mainly made using the Unity Game Engine. The game I am most proud of is called The Liminalverse. It was never and will never be finished, as the original files were on a now corrupted hard drive. However I am currently working on a game called The Monke Chronicles, which you can find more info at this link: https://epicjohn-studios.itch.io/tmc
